                <h1>About David</h1>
                    David Baird – 
                    <p>
                        A personal word from David: I have always had a deep love for the Word of God/Christ and it is my greatest joy to meditate upon them in the presence of the Holy Spirit and listen for His voice.  I have always been drawn to ask questions regarding accepted norms, dogma and traditional interpretations of various biblical subjects that have been handed down through generations. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even as a young person in my teens I would hear viewpoints that were accepted as established fact that simply did not resonate as truth to me.  There would be this unsettled feeling that something “just wasn’t right”.   As a young person I was too intimidated by those who were obviously more experienced and “spiritual” than I to be taken seriously with my musings and questionings.  Many subjects like:  What about Job?  Paul’s Thorn, the wilderness experience, the timing of the Lord etc. became a source of great interest and prayerful investigation for me.  I simply had to respond to this unsettled stirring in my spirit.  Phrases like… God is in control,  All things work together for good (which always seem to be spoken when something bad happens), Take up your cross and deny yourself,  Not my will but thine… all became a catalyst of seeking for hidden truth. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why were so many prayers going unanswered?  I simply could not acquiesce to the worn- out phrases of the church that so many have surrendered to:   It just wasn’t God’s will…  It just wasn’t God’s timing…  All things work together for good…  Something inside me would always bid me to look higher, deeper for truth to supersede these religious, worn out mantras.  The motivation has never been to prove everyone wrong, but rather to unearth a greater truth that would reveal the marvelous freedom we have in Christ.  Tradition, if accepted, can cause us to stop and never see the real revelation of Christ that was laying hidden for us.  
                        I trust the teachings that you hear on this site will be a fulfillment of this stirring to seek that has guided me all my life.  I trust  truth will gain the ascendancy above the bondage of previous tradition and dogma.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        David lives in Newnan, GA. with his wife of over 15 yrs.  He is the father of two daughters who are grown and have careers and family of their own. David is presently involved in Real Estate investments, mortgage lending and other entrepreneurial endeavors.   He has a varied background that included a Masters Degree in Education whereby he taught High School for 6 yrs.  He even was an Atlanta Police officer for a brief period.  This diverse background had given him a unique perspective on the dreams, aspirations and immense challenges that face everyday people. It is out of these experiences that most, if not all, of his teachings originate.
